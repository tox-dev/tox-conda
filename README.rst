``tox-conda`` is a plugin that provides integration with the `conda
<https://conda.io>`_ package and environment manager for the `tox
<https://tox.readthedocs.io>`__ automation tool. It's like having your cake and
eating it, too!

By default, ``tox`` creates isolated environments using `virtualenv
<https://virtualenv.pypa.io>`_ and installs dependencies from ``pip``.

With the ``tox-conda`` plugin, ``tox`` can be configured to use ``conda`` to
create environments, and will install specified dependencies from ``conda``.
This is useful for developers who rely on ``conda`` for environment management
and package distribution but want to take advantage of the features provided by
``tox`` for test automation.

Installation
------------

The ``tox-conda`` package is available on ``pypi``. To install, simply use the
following command:

::

   $ pip install tox-conda

To install from source, first clone the project from `github
<https://github.com/tox-dev/tox-conda>`_:

::

   $ git clone https://github.com/tox-dev/tox-conda

Then install it in your environment:

::

   $ cd tox-conda
   $ pip install .

To install in `development
mode <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/#working-in-development-mode>`__::

   $ pip install -e .

The ``tox-conda`` plugin expects that ``tox`` and ``conda`` are already installed and
available in your working environment.

Usage
-----

Details on ``tox`` usage can be found in the `tox documentation
<https://tox.readthedocs.io>`_.

With the plugin installed, ``tox-conda`` plugin enables using ``conda`` to create
environments and/or to install dependencies.

``tox-conda`` adds three additional (and optional) settings to the ``[testenv]``
section of configuration files:

* ``conda_deps``, which is used to configure which dependencies are installed
  from ``conda`` instead of from ``pip``. All dependencies in ``conda_deps`` are
  installed before all dependencies in ``deps``. If not given, no dependencies
  will be installed using ``conda``.

* ``conda_channels``, which specifies which channel(s) should be used for
  resolving ``conda`` dependencies. If not given, only the ``default`` channel will
  be used.

* ``conda_env``, which can be used to explicitly create environments using ``conda``,
  even if ``conda_deps`` is missing. If ``conda_deps`` is present, it takes precedence
  over ``conda_env`` and ``conda`` will be used for environment creation. Defaults to
  ``False``.

An example configuration file is given below:

::

   [tox]
   envlist =
       {py35,py36,py37}-{stable,dev}

   [testenv]
   deps=
       pytest-sugar
       py35,py36: importlib_resources
       dev: git+git://github.com/numpy/numpy
   conda_deps=
       pytest<=3.8
       stable: numpy=1.15
   conda_channels=
       conda-forge
   commands=
       pytest {posargs}

More information on ``tox`` configuration files can be found in the
`documentation <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html>`_.
