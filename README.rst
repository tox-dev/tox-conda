``tox-conda`` is a plugin that provides integration with the `conda
<https://conda.io>`_ package and environment manager for the `tox
<https://tox.readthedocs.io>`__ automation tool. It's like having your cake and
eating it, too!

By default, ``tox`` creates isolated environments using `virtualenv
<https://virtualenv.pypa.io>`_ and installs dependencies from ``pip``.

In contrast, when using the ``tox-conda`` plugin ``tox`` will use ``conda`` to create
environments, and will install specified dependencies from ``conda``. This is
useful for developers who rely on ``conda`` for environment management and
package distribution but want to take advantage of the features provided by
``tox`` for test automation.

Getting Started
---------------

``tox-conda`` can be used in one of two ways: by installing it globally and by
enabling it on a per-project basis. When the plugin is installed globally, the
default behavior of ``tox`` will be to use ``conda`` to create environments. To
use it on a per-project basis instead, use ``tox``'s auto-provisioning feature
to selectively enable the plugin.

To enable the use of ``tox-conda`` by default, follow the `Installation`_
instructions. To use the plugin selectively, do not manually install it, but
instead enable it by adding ``tox-conda`` as a provisioning requirement to a
project's ``tox`` config:

::

    [tox]
    requires = tox-conda

More information on auto-provisioning can be found in the `tox documentation
<https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example/basic.html#tox-auto-provisioning>`__.

Installation
------------

The ``tox-conda`` package is available on ``pypi``. To install, simply use the
following command:

::

   $ pip install tox-conda

To install from source, first clone the project from `github
<https://github.com/tox-dev/tox-conda>`_:

::

   $ git clone https://github.com/tox-dev/tox-conda

Then install it in your environment:

::

   $ cd tox-conda
   $ pip install .

To install in `development
mode <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/#working-in-development-mode>`__::

   $ pip install -e .

The ``tox-conda`` plugin expects that ``tox`` and ``conda`` are already installed and
available in your working environment.

Usage
-----

Details on ``tox`` usage can be found in the `tox documentation
<https://tox.readthedocs.io>`_.

With the plugin enabled and no other changes, the ``tox-conda`` plugin will use
``conda`` to create environments and use ``pip`` to install dependencies that are
given in the ``tox.ini`` configuration file.

``tox-conda`` adds four additional (and optional) settings to the ``[testenv]``
section of configuration files:

* ``conda_deps``, which is used to configure which dependencies are installed
  from ``conda`` instead of from ``pip``. All dependencies in ``conda_deps`` are
  installed before all dependencies in ``deps``. If not given, no dependencies
  will be installed using ``conda``.

* ``conda_channels``, which specifies which channel(s) should be used for
  resolving ``conda`` dependencies. If not given, only the ``default`` channel will
  be used.

* ``conda_spec``, which specifies a ``conda-spec.txt`` file that lists conda
  dependencies to install and will be combined with ``conda_deps`` (if given). These
  dependencies can be in a general from (e.g., ``numpy>=1.17.5``) or an explicit
  form (eg., https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64/numpy-1.17.5-py38h95a1406_0.tar.bz2),
  *however*, if the ``@EXPLICIT`` header is in ``conda-spec.txt``, *all* general
  dependencies will be ignored, including those given in ``conda_deps``.

* ``conda_env``, which specifies a ``conda-env.yml`` file to create a base conda
  environment for the test. The ``conda-env.yml`` file is self-contained and
  if the desired python version and conda channels to use is not given, the latest
  python version (if needed) and default channels will be used. The above ``conda_deps``,
  ``conda_channels``, and ``conda_spec`` arguments, if used in conjunction with
  a ``conda-env.yml`` file, will be used to *update* the environment *after* the
  initial environment creation.

An example configuration file is given below:

::

   [tox]
   envlist =
       {py35,py36,py37}-{stable,dev}

   [testenv]
   deps=
       pytest-sugar
       py35,py36: importlib_resources
       dev: git+git://github.com/numpy/numpy
   conda_deps=
       pytest<=3.8
       stable: numpy=1.15
   conda_channels=
       conda-forge
   commands=
       pytest {posargs}

More information on ``tox`` configuration files can be found in the
`documentation <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html>`_.
